# tuql

_Pronounced: Too cool_

**tuql** is a simple tool that turns a sanely formatted sqlite database into a graphql endpoint. It tries to infer relationships between objects, currently supporting `belongsTo`, `hasMany` and `belongsToMany`. Currently, only read operations are supported (no mutations).

## Installing

`npm install -g tuql`

## Using

`tuql --db path/to/database.sqlite`

You can also optionally set the port and enable graphiql:

`tuql --db path/to/database.sqlite --port 8888 --graphiql`

## How it works

Imagine your sqlite schema looked something like this:

| posts | users | categories | category_post |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| id Â     | id | id | category_id | 
| user_id | username | title | post_id |
| title   | | |
| body    | | |

**tuql** will automatically define models and associations, so that graphql queries like this will work right out of the box:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    title
    body
    user {
      username
    }
    categories {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
